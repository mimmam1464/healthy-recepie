Healthy recipes provide recipes for you that are perfect in nutrition for your intake.

## Inspiration

So many times as students we use online resources to look up recipes. And after looking at many delicious items on the list with their appealing pictures we end up making and consuming food out of our health needs.

## What it does

Provided age, weight, activity level, and height, Healthy Recipes provide a list of recipes that are catered to your calorie and other health needs.

## How we built it
I built this to try this idea as a concept and am looking to build on it if it turns to be useful. I used a simple HTML page and VueJS framework with Axios to handle the API calls to spoonacular dataset.

## Challenges we ran into
To figure out what details should make and what should not. Finding a search by max calorie was difficult in the dataset.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I built a website that I can myself use every other day in my apartment to prepare my meals in a healthy way.

## What we learned
Using spoonacular dataset API

## What's next for Healthy Recipe
I am going to add more features and improve the UX and prepare it to make it user ready and start using it fully.
